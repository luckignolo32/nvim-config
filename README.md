# nvim-config
My **Neovim configuration**. At the moment it's not that different from the one [Typecraft](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsz00TDipIffreIaUNk64KxTIkQaGguqn&si=bE3Yh-l74jpchEH0) did in his tutorial series (even if it was a bit outdated, so I had to change a few stuff, especially the part involving the LSP config). 

It works in neovim 0.11.2, and I do know for a fact that **it doesn't fully work in previous versions**.
